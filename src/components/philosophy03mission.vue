                <p>Our view is that most corporations waste valuable time and resources either forcing specialized, highly
                    paid, labour to manually execute repetitive tasks or strong-arming staff to learn and use overly complex
                    and
                    excessively burdensome software tools to perform otherwise simple tasks. Our belief is that corporations
                    are wasting tens, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars in the process. Our approach is simple:

                    <tr>
                        <td>• Facilitate effective data management, ensuring data is shared between systems and accurately
                            documented and recorded as it is created.</td>
